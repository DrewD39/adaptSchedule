# adaptSchedule

## Installation
This project was built in Eclipse. In order to run a clone of this project in eclipse you will need to set up a Java 1.8 JRE in eclipse and copy over all required .JAR library files (which are too big to include in this repo).

## Abstract:
The complexity and pace of modern life can tax the cognitive abilities of persons without disabilities, meaning that
persons whose disabilities introduce additional needs and complications into their daily schedules face daunting
decision challenges. We are designing, prototyping, and evaluating decision-support technologies to augment the
cognition of inexperienced adolescent decision-makers in order to allow them to independently manage their daily
schedule safely, and improve their understanding of how immediate decisions have consequences on the scheduling of work, social, and healthcare activities over the course of a day.

## Current work:
The research validating the feasibility of allowing users to plan their own daily schedule in a flexible and dynamic way
has been completed over the past couple of years. Through this research, many different systems and features have been
implmented into a growing codebsase by independent researchers. The focus now (my focus) is to bring the variety of
research features together into a fully functional system that demonstrates what the culmination of work is capable of,
in a commercial product. This is being done through the implementation of a server-client system and a iOS interface.
The server allows multiple clients to independently connect and interact with their interlinked schedules rmemotely.
The interface provides an intuitive and simple way for potential users to interact with a complex scheduling system on
a mobile device.
